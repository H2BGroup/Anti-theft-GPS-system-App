# Engineering thesis: Anti-theft GPS system for cyclists

## Project Overview

The main goal of the project was creating a system that helps to secure a bike against theft and remotely monitor its location. This is the repository containing the code for the application part of the project.

## Technologies
The application was developed using the Flutter framework and tested in Android Studio.

## Features
Users can navigate through three tabs:

- **Map View** – Allows users to check the location of their bike.
- **Device Status View** – Displays the battery status and provides options to arm or disarm the device.
- **Settings View** – Enables users to customize settings related to system usage.

The application also keeps users informed about important events through phone notifications and provides a widget that allows users to switch the device's operating mode without opening the app.

## Running the Application

Use the following command to start the application:
   ```
   flutter run lib/main.dart
   ```
